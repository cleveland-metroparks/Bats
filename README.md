# Bat call file copying and counting

This project is designed to take output from a program that classifies .wav files from recordings from a bat detector, copy them to folders by species, and produce a manifest of what is in each folder

The manifest will allow users to check species classifications and see second and third guesses.

It is based on using Kaleidiscope and Wildlife Acoustics recorders.
